# Introduction to Numpy
<br>
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is a cornerstone library in the Python data science ecosystem and is widely used for numerical and mathematical operations.
